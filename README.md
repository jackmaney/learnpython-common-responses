# /r/learnpython common responses

## Goal

This repository intends to be a collection of good responses that can be used
in reply to posts in /r/learnpython. The original idea, suggested by /u/elbiot,
is that someone might write a Reddit bot that would post one of these responses
when summoned.

## How to contribute

Either open an **issue** or send a **pull request**. If you haven't used Git and
Github much, opening an issue will be much easier for you.

## The responses

For now, the responses are inlined here. If this file starts to get too long, I
will split the responses into separate files.

### `formatting`: Formatting code for Reddit

To achieve properly-formatted code in a Reddit post or comment:

* Prepend four spaces to each line of code.
* Ensure blank lines separate the code from surrounding text.

For example, typing this

    Use a list comprehension:

        squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

will produce a post that looks like this

> Use a list comprehension:
>
>     squares =  [x**2 for x in range(10)]

### `gists`: Third party sites to host longer code blocks

If you have a long snippet of code that you don't already have in a code hosting site (eg [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)) and that looks too unwieldy for an inline code block, consider creating a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) (requires a (free) GitHub account) or using [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/).
